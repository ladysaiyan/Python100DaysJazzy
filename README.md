# Jzzy Journey - Learning Python
---
## Getting started
I will get into how I started this journey in more detail maybe another time but let's just say it involved, prayer, changes to my job, AI, personal projects, and a desire to learn something new!

Below I am going to share where I started and where I am at currently when it came to learning.
- Talked to my husband about joing me in learning Python (now we are a team working on this together)
- Researching Training Course
- Downloading Tool for usage VS Studio or VS Studio Code
- Customizing my VS Studio, theme wise because this was the best I could do to learn how to use it lol. Also I wanted it to be in colors that felt good to me ( I went with a cyberpunk purple and green)
- Purchase a book ok Coding projects with Python
- Looked up Python on the VS Code for EDU which was a great start. Unit 1 was fantastic
- Realized I needed more projects so started doing the projects within my book
- Husband recommened we look at the Udemy course 100 Days of Coding (which is absolutly fantastic)
  1.  Has projects, easy to learn lessons, some challenges, and was on sale for $18 at the time
  2.  on Day 2.5 I created my first Python Visual Novel game test using [Ren'py](https://www.renpy.org/) (my younger sister put me on to this)
-   Looked for Github courses like this one [Mastering Github Copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/Mastering-GitHub-Copilot-for-Paired-Programming)
-   Also took a live Github course at work

So that is my journey so far, as you can see I am documenting it within Github for others to see
